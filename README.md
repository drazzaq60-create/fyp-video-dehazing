# FYP: Cloud-Based Live Video Dehazing

This project implements a cloud-based real-time video dehazing system
using deep learning. The system uses a GPU cloud server for video
processing and integrates with a Node.js backend and a React Native
mobile application.

## Main Features
- Live video dehazing
- Cloud GPU inference
- Low bandwidth streaming
- Mobile app integration
- Fallback local processing

## Model
DVD (Deep Video Dehazing) is used for real-time video enhancement.
